# Email-Spam-Detection-using-Naive-Bayes-or-SVM
In this project, a machine learning model is developed to classify emails as Spam or Not Spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset contains labeled email text data, which is vectorized using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer. The Naive Bayes algorithm (or optionally SVM) is applied for classification.

## âœ… Task 1: Email Spam Detection using Naive Bayes or SVM
